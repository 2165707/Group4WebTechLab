						Who would have thought that bunch of garbages is visible at Camp John Hay? 
						If you are going to observe, some areas in the place are lacking or don't have
						available trash bins, so people tend to throw their trashes anywhere which is still
						not a good reason. 
						The Bin It project is implemented to help discipline people regarding proper
						handling of their waste by providing more trash bins which are also labeled 
						for correct segregation.
