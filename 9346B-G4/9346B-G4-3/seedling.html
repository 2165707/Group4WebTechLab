					<p>As time goes by, more and more infrastructures are built at 
						Camp John Hay. Some trees are being cut for the buildings to have their
						place. It is alarming that in the near future, Camp John Hay will be no 
						different to places clustered with nothing but huge infrastructures.
						The Seedling project aims to prevent it from happening. Aside from a petition
						to limit the capacity for the infrastructures, this project involves 
						tree planting on certain areas of Camp John Hay.
						Isn't it relaxing to see a green landscape?
						Isn't it nice to breathe fresh air?</p>
