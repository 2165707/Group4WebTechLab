					<p>As time goes by, more and more infrastructures are built at 
						Camp John Hay. Some trees are being cut for the buildings to have their
						place. Another one is that the automobiles entering the area are increasing adding
						more pollution to the air.
						It is alarming that in the near future, Camp John Hay will be no 
						different to places clustered with nothing but huge infrastructures and automobiles releasing
						harmful gases.
						The Seedling project aims to resolve these. Aside from a petition
						to limit the capacity for the infrastructures and automobiles entering, this project involves 
						tree planting on certain areas of Camp John Hay.
						Isn't it relaxing to see a green landscape?
						Isn't it good to breathe fresh air?
