				<h3>Seedling</h3>

					<img src="images/Infras.jpg" alt="Building">
					<p>As time goes by, more and more infrastructures are built at 
						Camp John Hay. Some trees are being cut for the buildings to have their
						place. It is alarming that in the near future, Camp John Hay will be no 
						different to places clustered with nothing but huge infrastructures.
						The Seedling project aims to prevent it from happening. Aside from a petition
						to limit the capacity for the infrastructures, this project involves 
						tree planting on certain areas of Camp John Hay.
						Isn't it relaxing to see a green landscape?
						Isn't it nice to breathe fresh air?</p>

					<h3>Bin It!</h3>

					<img src="images/poor people.jpg" alt="garbage">

					<p>
						Who would have thought that bunch of garbages are visible at Camp John Hay? 
						If you are going to observe, some areas in the place are lacking or don't have
						available trash bins, so people tend to throw their trashes anywhere (still not
						a good reason to do it tho). 
						The Bin It project is implemented to help discipline people regarding proper
						handling of their waste by providing more trash bins which are also labeled 
						for correct segregation.
