				<h2>About Us</h2>

				<p>Camp John Hay is the most popular tourist spot in the City of Pines. It is known for having its wide open area
					and green landscape making it a great place for relaxation and recreation. Here, people can do activities such as 
					rapelling, picnic, shopping, trailing, and horseback riding. They can also have the tree-top adventure, and golfers can
					go and play at the golf course. On the other side of Camp John Hay being a tourist attraction, the problem it faces 
					regarding the environment cannot be denied. 
					<br>
					Within the past decades until now, environmental problems continue to arise causing natural disasters, health problems, and other 
					forms of destruction. Environment is a part of us, and we, Green Side, intends to educate people and raise awareness about
					protecting the environment of Camp John Hay.</p>
