Green Side implements several projects for improving the environmental protection
of Camp John Hay.

 - Seedling

	As time goes by, more and more infrastructures are built at 
	Camp John Hay. Some trees are being cut for the buildings to have their
	place. It is alarming that in the near future, Camp John Hay will be no 
	different to places clustered with nothing but huge infrastructures.
	The Seedling project aims to prevent it from happening. Aside from a petition
	to limit the capacity for the infrastructures, this project involves 
	tree planting on certain areas of Camp John Hay.
	Isn't it relaxing to see a green landscape?
	Isn't it nice to breathe fresh air?

- Bin It

	Who would have thought that bunch of garbages are visible at Camp John Hay? 
	If you are going to observe, some areas in the place are lacking or don't have
	available trash bins, so people tend to throw their trashes anywhere (still not
	a good reason to do it tho). 
	The Bin It project is implemented to help discipline people regarding proper
	handling of their waste by providing more trash bins which are also labeled 
	for correct segregation. 
	"With self-discipline most anything is possible." -Theodore Roosevelt
